# Signature requests over the REST API (v2)

For app code. Send every request to `https://sync.api.docspring.com/api/v2` (EU:
`https://sync.api-eu.docspring.com/api/v2`) with HTTP Basic auth: the API token's ID as the username, its secret as
the password. The 4.x API clients read `DOCSPRING_TOKEN_ID`, `DOCSPRING_TOKEN_SECRET` and `DOCSPRING_REGION` from the
environment; `docspring-api-integration` covers setting them up.

## 1. Endpoints

| Operation (client method)     | Endpoint                                                 | What it does                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `createSubmission`            | `POST /templates/{template_id}/submissions`              | Creates the submission and its signature requests. |
| `getSubmission`               | `GET /submissions/{submission_id}`                       | The submission, its signature requests and files.  |
| `expireSubmission`            | `DELETE /submissions/{submission_id}`                    | Cancels it: deletes its data, links stop working.  |
| `getSignatureRequest`         | `GET /signature_requests/{signature_request_id}`         | One signature request, with the values so far.     |
| `updateSignatureRequest`      | `PUT /signature_requests/{signature_request_id}`         | Changes its metadata or authentication details.    |
| `createSignatureRequestToken` | `POST /signature_requests/{signature_request_id}/tokens` | Makes a signing link.                              |
| `createSignatureRequestEvent` | `POST /signature_requests/{signature_request_id}/events` | Records that you sent the link.                    |

Ruby, Python and Elixir name the methods in snake case (createSubmission becomes create_submission); JavaScript,
TypeScript, PHP and Java use the names above, and C# and Go capitalize them. In Ruby, Python, JavaScript and
TypeScript the request body is a plain hash or object with the API's snake case property names.

## 2. The signature request properties

The create request's body takes the usual submission properties (`test`, `data`, `metadata`, `expires_in`,
`password`, `field_overrides`, and the `version` query parameter) plus `signature_requests`, up to 100 of:

| Property                                                                                    | Required    | Notes                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fields`                                                                                    | yes         | Field names this person fills in. At least one; each field in only one list.     |
| `auth_type`                                                                                 | yes         | `email_link`, `password`, `oauth`, `phone_number`, `ldap` or `saml` (section 8). |
| `name`, `email`                                                                             | no          | Shown on the audit trail. DocSpring never emails this address.                   |
| `role`                                                                                      | no          | `Signer 1` to `Signer 100`. All signature requests have one, or none does.       |
| `metadata`                                                                                  | no          | Your own data, such as the signer's ID in your app.                              |
| `prefilled_values_editable`                                                                 | no          | Lets the person change values that `data` has for their fields.                  |
| `ignore_unknown_fields`                                                                     | no          | Drops names the template doesn't have, instead of `invalid_data`.                |
| `auth_second_factor_type`                                                                   | no          | `none`, `phone_number`, `totp`, `mobile_push`, `security_key`, `fingerprint`.    |
| `auth_provider`                                                                             | for `oauth` | The service that signed them in, such as `google`.                               |
| `auth_session_started_at`                                                                   | no          | When your app signed them in. Set for you with `email_link`.                     |
| `auth_session_id_hash`, `auth_user_id_hash`, `auth_username_hash`, `auth_phone_number_hash` | no          | Hashes for the audit trail (section 8).                                          |

`data` is optional with signature requests (required without them). `editable: true` isn't allowed.

## 3. Code

curl:

```bash
curl -s -u "$DOCSPRING_TOKEN_ID:$DOCSPRING_TOKEN_SECRET" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST https://sync.api.docspring.com/api/v2/templates/tpl_.../submissions \
  -d '{
    "test": true,
    "data": { "company_name": "Acme Inc." },
    "signature_requests": [
      { "name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com", "fields": ["employee_signature"], "auth_type": "email_link" }
    ]
  }'

# Then, for each signature_requests[].id in the response:
curl -s -u "$DOCSPRING_TOKEN_ID:$DOCSPRING_TOKEN_SECRET" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -X POST https://sync.api.docspring.com/api/v2/signature_requests/srq_.../tokens \
  -d '{ "type": "email" }'
```

Ruby (`docspring` gem, 4.x):

```ruby
require 'docspring'

client = DocSpring::Client.new # reads DOCSPRING_TOKEN_ID, DOCSPRING_TOKEN_SECRET and DOCSPRING_REGION

submission = client.create_submission('tpl_...', {
  test: true,
  data: { company_name: 'Acme Inc.' },
  signature_requests: [
    { name: 'Jane Smith', email: 'jane@example.com', fields: ['employee_signature'], auth_type: 'email_link' },
  ],
})

submission.signature_requests.each do |signature_request|
  token = client.create_signature_request_token(signature_request.id, body: { type: 'email' })
  # Email token.signature_request_url to signature_request.email from your app, then record it:
  client.create_signature_request_event(signature_request.id, {
    event_type: 'send_request', message_type: 'email', message_recipient: signature_request.email,
  })
end
```

Python (`docspring` package, 4.x):

```python
from docspring import Client

client = Client()  # reads DOCSPRING_TOKEN_ID, DOCSPRING_TOKEN_SECRET and DOCSPRING_REGION

submission = client.create_submission("tpl_...", {
    "test": True,
    "data": {"company_name": "Acme Inc."},
    "signature_requests": [
        {"name": "Jane Smith", "email": "jane@example.com", "fields": ["employee_signature"], "auth_type": "email_link"},
    ],
})

for signature_request in submission.signature_requests:
    token = client.create_signature_request_token(signature_request.id, body={"type": "email"})
    # Email token.signature_request_url from your app, then record it:
    client.create_signature_request_event(signature_request.id, {
        "event_type": "send_request", "message_type": "email", "message_recipient": signature_request.email,
    })
```

JavaScript calls `createSubmission(templateId, body)` and `createSignatureRequestEvent(signatureRequestId, body)`, with
the same snake case bodies. Its token call takes the body in an options object, because the body is optional:
`createSignatureRequestToken(signatureRequestId, { body: { type: 'email' } })`. TypeScript passes each body directly,
as the second argument. Its enum properties take the enums (`DocSpring.SignatureRequestTokenType.Email`,
`DocSpring.SignatureRequestEventType.SendRequest`, `DocSpring.SignatureRequestMessageType.Email`,
`DocSpring.SignatureRequestAuthType.Oauth` and so on), and its times are `Date` objects.

The clients check a request against the API's schema before sending it, so a signature request without `auth_type`
raises a validation error with a `pointer` to it.

## 4. Signing links (tokens)

`POST /signature_requests/{signature_request_id}/tokens` with `{"type": "email"}` (7 days) or no body (`api`, 24
hours). The response:

```json
{
  "id": "1234567890abcdef01",
  "signature_request_id": "srq_...",
  "type": "email",
  "secret": "ABCDEF01234567890",
  "signature_request_url": "https://app.docspring.com/signature_requests/srq_...?token_id=...&token_secret=...",
  "expires_at": "...",
  "created_at": "..."
}
```

- `signature_request_url` opens DocSpring's hosted signing page. For an embedded form, pass `id` and `secret` to the
  page as `tokenId` and `tokenSecret` (`references/embedding.md`).
- `secret` is only in this response. Make a token each time you send or show the form; don't store one to reuse.
- A signing page that opened while the link worked keeps working for 7 more days.
- 409 once the signature request is completed, declined or expired. 403 with a test API token on a live signature
  request.

## 5. Recording that you sent the link (events)

`POST /signature_requests/{signature_request_id}/events`:

```json
{
  "event_type": "send_request",
  "message_type": "email",
  "message_recipient": "jane@example.com"
}
```

- `send_request` is the only event type. `message_type` and `message_recipient` are required for it.
- `message_type`: `email`, `sms`, `fax`, `mail`, `slack`, `msteams`, `discord`, `telegram` or `whatsapp`.
- `occurred_at` defaults to now.
- The audit trail shows it as "Reported by <account> via API". DocSpring records views, signatures, declines and
  completion itself.
- 409 once the signature request is finished. 403 with a test API token on a live one.

## 6. Updating authentication details

`PUT /signature_requests/{signature_request_id}` takes `metadata` and the `auth_*` properties, for when the person
signed in again before they opened the form. Once they've opened it, only `metadata` can change; a completed or
declined signature request can't change at all (409). `name`, `email` and `fields` can never change: expire the
submission and create a new signature request.

## 7. Errors

The create request checks the request's shape first. These are 422 `validation_failed`, and nothing is saved:

| `details[].code` | `pointer`                        | Cause                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `duplicate`      | `/signature_requests/1/fields/0` | The field is in another signature request's `fields`.       |
| `duplicate`      | `/signature_requests/1/role`     | Another signature request has this role.                    |
| `prefilled`      | `/signature_requests/0/fields/2` | `data` has a value for it: set `prefilled_values_editable`. |
| `required`       | `/signature_requests/0/role`     | Some signature requests have a role and this one doesn't.   |
| `invalid`        | `/signature_requests/0/role`     | Not `Signer 1` to `Signer 100`.                             |
| `other_signer`   | `/signature_requests/0/fields/1` | Another signer's formula or show/hide rule uses this field. |
| `not_allowed`    | `/editable`                      | `editable: true` with signature requests.                   |
| `not_allowed`    | `/signature_requests`            | The template is an HTML template.                           |

Errors that depend on the template save the submission as `invalid_data` and return a 422 `invalid_data` with its
`submission_id`: a field name the template doesn't have, a signature or initials value in `data` or in a field
override's `default`, or a required field that neither `data` nor any signer fills in. Nobody can sign it: fix the
request and create a new one.

Other statuses: 403 when a demo API token creates signature requests or a test API token acts on a live signature
request; 404 for an ID from another account or region; 409 for a finished signature request.

## 8. Authentication details for the audit trail

The audit trail's **Signer Authentication** section shows what you send, as stated by the account. Send as much as is
true:

- `email_link`: you emailed the person a link and they opened it. DocSpring sets `auth_session_started_at` when they
  first open it.
- Your app signed them in and shows the embedded form: their sign-in method as `auth_type` (with `auth_provider` for
  `oauth`), `auth_session_started_at`, and `auth_second_factor_type` if they used one.
- `auth_user_id_hash`, `auth_username_hash`, `auth_session_id_hash`, `auth_phone_number_hash`: a SHA-256 hash of a
  salt and the value. Never send a plaintext session ID. Use one salt for all of them and keep it, or the hashes
  can't be matched to your records later. Salt incrementing user IDs.

## 9. Existing API v1 code

API v1 and the 3.x clients use the old names for the same records. Write new code against API v2 and keep the names
customers see as "signature requests":

| API v1                                     | API v2                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `data_requests` in the create body         | `signature_requests`              |
| `/data_requests/{id}`                      | `/signature_requests/{id}`        |
| `data_request_url` on a token              | `signature_request_url`           |
| state `waiting_for_data_requests`          | `waiting_for_signature_requests`  |
| webhook events `submission_data_request.*` | `signature_request.*` (version 4) |

The IDs are the same in both APIs: `srq_...` for new signature requests, `drq_...` for older ones.
